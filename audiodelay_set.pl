#
#	For delaying audio by a set time. Great for syncing up audio that is always
#	ahead of a video stream, like listening to the radio for a sports game while
#	watching it on TV.
#
#	Usage: perl audiodelay_set.pl --number of seconds for delay--
#
#	Usage Options.
#	
#	You may need to change the input and output port assignments to suit your
#	setup.
#	
#	To determine how your audio devices are assigned run aplay as shown in the 
#	following example:
#	
#	$ aplay -l
#	
#	**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
#	card 0: ALSA [bcm2835 ALSA], device 0: bcm2835 ALSA [bcm2835 ALSA]
#	  Subdevices: 7/8
#	  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
#	  Subdevice #1: subdevice #1
#	  Subdevice #2: subdevice #2
#	  Subdevice #3: subdevice #3
#	  Subdevice #4: subdevice #4
#	  Subdevice #5: subdevice #5
#	  Subdevice #6: subdevice #6
#	  Subdevice #7: subdevice #7
#	card 1: system [iMic USB audio system], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
#	  Subdevices: 1/1
#	  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
#	
#	This shows that card 0 is the built in audio device (bcm2835) and card 1 is 
#	a Griffin iMic USB audio device.
#	
#	This translates to the following lines in the script:
#	
#	my $input_device = "-D plughw:1";
#	my $output_device = " ";
#	
#	These lines may need to be altered to suit your audio devices and their 
#	order.
#	
#	Also, you may need to change the audio levels on the Raspberry Pi to suit 
#	the audio source and output, do this by running the following:
#	
#	$ alsamixer
#	
#	and then follow the on-screen instructions to adjust the volume.
